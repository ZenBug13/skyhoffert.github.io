    <p>
A lonely asteroid wanders through a cold, dark Universe.<br>
She follows her typical path without going much off course.<br>
<br>
Her name is Haley, she is kind but quiet.<br>
Unfortunately wherever she goes, it is completely silent.<br>
<br>
In every direction are lights that seem very distant.<br>
She aimed for one, but unfortunately she missed it!<br>
<br>
Just as she felt upset and lonely once more,<br>
Another light approaches before she can feel bored.<br>
<br>
She can see from afar that his Star’s smile is shining,<br>
Nervous as she approaches for there is no hiding.<br>
<br>
The bright star named “Sol” says brightly, “Hello!<br>
I’ve got comets and planets with me, be careful where you go!”<br>
<br>
And so she went on, nervous and wary.<br>
Being in a new place like this is exciting, but scary.<br>
<br>
On her tour of this new place another asteroid appears.<br>
“Uhh, excuse me - I’m Haley. Nice to meet you here.”<br>
<br>
The Asteroid turns with eyes wide open.<br>
He is pleased to see her, his smile unbroken.<br>
<br>
“Why Hello! I’m Bennu, Welcome to our home!<br>
We hope you enjoy your trip and don’t feel so alone!<br>
<br>
I am heading to Earth to learn about life.<br>
Care to join? We can go side by side.”<br>
<br>
Haley happily says yes to his invitation.<br>
She will be less lonely if she stays with him.<br>
<br>
Eventually they arrive at the planet Earth.<br>
They have a lot to learn before they go forth.<br>
<br>
“Greetings, asteroids! I hope your tour so far has been alright.”<br>
“It is great! We are now here to learn about your life!”<br>
<br>
“Well I have humans, buffalos, whales, and tigers,<br>
Giraffes, elephants, mice, and spiders!<br>
<br>
There are also tiny forms of life you can’t even see<br>
Life is everywhere when you travel on me!”<br>
<br>
“Wow - That is amazing! You are completely covered in it.<br>
Do you know if there is more life on other planets?”<br>
<br>
“Well Mars used to have some, but now he is too cold.<br>
Long ago he had long rivers, like mine, where life flowed.<br>
<br>
Venus did as well but now she is far too warm.<br>
But over time all planets - well, they transform.<br>
<br>
Jupiter and Saturn have moons with oceans below ice.<br>
But I do not know for sure if they have life.”<br>
<br>
“It is amazing to hear about Jupiter, Venus, and Mars.<br>
Do you know if there is life around other Stars?”<br>
<br>
Earth pauses for a second before she begins to say,<br>
“I am afraid I do not know because they are too far away.”<br>
<br>
Haley is suddenly very curious about this -<br>
Before now she never thought about it!<br>
<br>
Haley asks Bennu, “Would you want to go?<br>
We can explore the Stars and then we will know!”<br>
<br>
Bennu seems unsure about this adventure.<br>
After all, he only just met her.<br>
<br>
Haley says, “I know that it makes you nervous -<br>
But so was I before learning what Earth’s lesson was!<br>
<br>
If we go together, then we will never feel alone.<br>
I am not so nervous now that I have a new friend to get to know.”<br>
<br>
Bennu cracks a smile and says “Let’s go!<br>
But first I have a question to ask Pluto.”<br>
<br>
Before they leave, they thank Earth for her time.<br>
She says “You two are always friends of mine.”<br>
<br>
Now Haley and Bennu go to Pluto, who is waaaay out.<br>
To get there, they have a long and winding route.<br>
<br>
After some time they finally arrive.<br>
Pluto gives them a smile, with a look of delight.<br>
<br>
“Ah a new group of visitors I see!<br>
Thank you for taking the time to come visit me.”<br>
<br>
Bennus says, “Hello Pluto, I am Bennu.<br>
This is my friend Haley, pleasure to meet you!<br>
<br>
Haley and I are off to explore the Stars.<br>
I have one question for you before we depart.<br>
<br>
I hear that you used to be a planet, but now you are not.<br>
Is that okay, or is being a planet what you really want?”<br>
<br>
Pluto smirks and says, “Excellent question young one!<br>
My answer is simple and something you may find fun.<br>
<br>
It is not so important the names that people call you,<br>
As it is the great and wonderful things that you do.<br>
<br>
Whatever they call me, they know I have a story.<br>
They know I am nice, and they know they can trust me.<br>
<br>
Whether you are an asteroid, comet, planet, or anything else,<br>
The only thing you can do is be unique as yourself!”<br>
<br>
Haley looks at Bennu with a smile.<br>
She knows that is something they will remember for a while.<br>
<br>
So finally they are ready to explore.<br>
More excited now than they ever were before.<br>
<br>
It may be a scary place out there without each other,<br>
But your journeys are always better when you have another.<br>
<br>
Off to explore the Stars Bennu and Haley go!<br>
With him she knows she will not feel so alone.<br>
