    rand(), Math.random(), etc. - if you work with programming languages, you have probably
    come across this method of generating a random value. An important assumption that you are
    making when you do this is that you want values from a <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.
    I don't mean to assume I know anything about you, but that is probably exactly what you wanted
    to do :)

    Imagine closing your eyes and placing your finger somewhere in the shaded region in this image.
    Notice that at <strong>any</strong> point in the range from 0 to 1, there is an 
    <strong>equal</strong> likelihood that your finger will be above a given point. There is
    <strong>NO</strong> chance you will place your finger outside the range, you are skilled with
    your eyes closed!
    <br><br>
    Now conveniently, we can use math to modify the value that we place our finger above.
    Say we <strong>multiply</strong> whatever value we receive by <strong>2</strong>. How have we
    affected the
    result? Well put simply, we have increased the <strong>range</strong> of our value. Now instead
    of being between 0 and 1, the value will be between 0 and 2. But we retain the property that
    any value in this range is <strong>equally</strong> likely.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Cool! So that makes sense. You can twist and turn this range all you want by adding,
    subtracting, etc. For example, if we <strong>subtract 1</strong> from this new range, we manage
    to shift it down by, you guessed it, 1.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Straightforward, right? If you are an experienced programmer or you know math well, this may
    seem trivial to you. But now I'll provide some more interesting insight.
    <br><br>
    No matter what we do - add, subtract, multiply, divide by constants - we will always retain 
    this property of <strong>equal</strong> (or better yet, uniform) likelihood. But there are ways
    that we can change this property to some other, what is called, <i>distribution</i>.
    <br><br>
    A simple example is if we take the first value from the range of 0 to 1 and multiply it by
    <strong>itself</strong>. You may know this as... not triangling or circling... but
    <i>squaring</i> the value. This will cause an important change in the graph.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <i>Well would you look at that!</i> We no longer have the flat line representing the
    likelihood. Now, it is a <strong>curve</strong>. If you examine the graph, you should be able to work
    out in your mind that small values in the range 0 to 1 are more likely to find our falling
    finger. The area near the right end (at 1) is <strong>much</strong> smaller than the area
    around 0.
    <br><br>
    Now, you should be wondering <i>why exactly</i> value are more likely to be near 0 than 1. Time
    for some math - but don't worry, <strong>it is simple math!</strong> What is the value of 0,
    squared (I'll use this notation: 0<sup>2</sup>)? Well multiplying 0 x 0 results in a value of
    ... well 0! What about 1<sup>2</sup>? 1 x 1 = 1. This math is super simple. Now for a more
    interesting multiplication. What is (0.5)<sup>2</sup>? Well if you plugged this in your
    calculator, you would find a value of 0.25. What about 0.9<sup>2</sup>? What about 
    0.1<sup>2</sup>? I'll write down some common values below.
    <br><br>
    0<sup>2</sup> = 0<br>
    0.1<sup>2</sup> = 0.01<br>
    0.2<sup>2</sup> = 0.04<br>
    0.5<sup>2</sup> = 0.25<br>
    0.9<sup>2</sup> = 0.81<br>
    1<sup>2</sup> = 1
    <br><br>
    The moral of the story is, when you square a value between 0 and 1, it becomes 
    <strong>smaller</strong>. With this logic, it is more likely that the value is small than large.
    I have made it a point to emphasize what is going on here because, well, it is important to
    understand how we will be working with the uniform distribution.
    <br><br>
    Now, time for something cool. Remember the "<i>*modified *modified Uniform Distribution</i>" from
    above? Well recall that it was a uniform distrubtion taking values between -1 and 1. Consider 
    any value in that range, <strong>squared</strong>. We just figured out what the graph will look
    like between 0 and 1. If you know anything about negative numbers, it should at least be that a
    negative times a negative becomes a positive.
    <br><br>
    With a little intuition, you may reason that the final distribution should look something like
    this:
    <br><br>
    <img src="laplace_basic.png">
    <br><br>
    This shows that by taking the original uniform distribution in the range -1 to 1 and squaring
    it, we are <i>much</i> more likely to find values closer to 0 than we are near 1 or -1.
    <br><br>
    This looks like a Laplace Distribution. The name of this isn't so important, and truth be told
    it is not even the correct equation to find this particular distribution (I call it
    Laplace-like), but the point is that we have <i>emulated</i> a certain probability distribution
    with a simple translation from a uniform distribution. How fascinating!
    <br><br>
    Now we could take it upon ourselves to modify this even more! Say we want a range of -4 to 4.
    Multiplying by 4 would suffice! We could even square the value again to get a <i>tighter</i>
    slope around 0, which makes values near 0 <strong>very</strong> likely. The world is your
    playground!
    <br><br>
    Now, for the final part of this blog post: the <strong>Normal</strong> Distribution. The
    normal, or Gaussian, distribution is a very common distribution that we observe in the real
    world. What I want to cover here is how to convert from a uniform distribution to a normal
    distribution.
