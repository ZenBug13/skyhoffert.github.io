    rand(), Math.random(), etc. - if you work with programming languages, you have probably
    come across this method of generating a random value. An important assumption that you are
    making when you do this is that you want values from a <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.
    I don't mean to assume I know anything about you, but that is probably exactly what you wanted
    to do :)

    Imagine closing your eyes and placing your finger somewhere in the shaded region in this image.
    Notice that at <strong>any</strong> point in the range from 0 to 1, there is an 
    <strong>equal</strong> likelihood that your finger will be above a given point. There is
    <strong>NO</strong> chance you will place your finger outside the range, you are skilled with
    your eyes closed!
    <br><br>
    Now conveniently, we can use math to modify the value that we place our finger above.
    Say we <strong>multiply</strong> whatever value we receive by <strong>2</strong>. How have we
    affected the
    result? Well put simply, we have increased the <strong>range</strong> of our value. Now instead
    of being between 0 and 1, the value will be between 0 and 2. But we retain the property that
    any value in this range is <strong>equally</strong> likely.

    Cool! So that makes sense. You can twist and turn this range all you want by adding,
    subtracting, etc. For example, if we <strong>subtract 1</strong> from this new range, we manage
    to shift it down by, you guessed it, 1.

    Straightforward, right? If you are an experienced programmer or you know math well, this may
    seem trivial to you. But now I'll provide some more interesting insight.
    <br><br>
    No matter what we do - add, subtract, multiply, divide by constants - we will always retain 
    this property of <strong>equal</strong> (or better yet, Uniform) likelihood. But there are ways
    that we can change this property to some other, what is called, <i>distribution</i>.
    <br><br>
    A simple example is if we take the first value from the range of 0 to 1 and multiply it by
    <strong>itself</strong>. You may know this as... not triangling or circling... but
    <i>squaring</i> the value. This will cause an important change in the graph.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    <i>Well would you look at that!</i> We no longer have the flat line representing the
    likelihood. Now, it is a <strong>curve</strong>. If you examine the graph, you should be able to work
    out in your mind that small values in the range 0 to 1 are more likely to find our falling
    finger. The area near the right end (at 1) is <strong>much</strong> smaller than the area
    around 0.
